[s0;i448;a25;kKO9;@(0.0.255)%- &]
[s0; U`+`+ logging infrastructure is based on output stream, which 
is capable of outputting log lines into decided output facilities 
(files, console output, syslog).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Logging itself is then based on set o macros that output values 
to this stream, usually using AsString or operator<<(Stream`&, 
...) to convert values.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; This stream is accessible through UppLog() function and its 
default version is provided by U`+`+, however it can be replaced 
(using SetUppLog).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Multithreading note: Standard log stream handles serialization 
of output in its implementation  (and any possible replacement 
should do that too), so it is possible to use single output stream 
in all threads.&]

[s0; &]
[s0; Standard logging macros come in 3 basic flavors. `"Normal`" 
macros (LOG, DUMP, ...) only emit code in debug mode, `"Debugging`" 
macros (DLOG, DDUMP, ..., first letter is `'D`') only [*/ compile] 
in debug mode and their presence causes release mode compilation 
to fail (this is to prevent any forgotten debugging macros in 
code) and finally `"Release`" macros (RLOG, RDUMP, ..., first 
letter is `'R`') produce output even in release mode.&]
[s0; &]
[ {{5000:5000^ [s0; LOG(x), DLOG(x), RLOG(x)]
:: [s0; Outputs a single line to log.]
:: [s0; DUMP(x), DDUMP(x), RDUMP(x)]
:: [s0; Outputs a variable `- adds a variable name before value `-  
defined as LOG(#x << `"`=`" << x)]
:: [s0; DUMPC(x), DDUMPC(x), RDUMPC(x)]
:: [s0; Outputs a Vector or Array or Index of values.]
:: [s0; DUMPM(x), DDUMPM(x), RDUMPM(x)]

definition till the end of block, profiling values are printed 
to log at the program exit.]

:: [s0; Outputs value as hexadecimal dump, currently works with String.]
:: [s0; DUMPHEX(x), DDUMPHEX(x), RDUMPHEX(x)]
:: [s0; Outputs variable as hexadecimal dump, like LOGHEX but puts variable 
name into log.]}}&]
[s0; &]
[s0; In addition to this it is common practice to use `'local`' macros 
that can be switched on/off for given modules files; standard 
approach is to add&]
[s0; &]
[s0; #define LLOG(x)    // DLOG(x)&]
[s0; &]
[s0; at the start of files with local logging, then activate logging 
by uncommenting the DLOG.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; U`+`+ has also concept of `"modular`" logging, where specific 
logging macros can be created that are bound to some global boolean 
entity (usually INI`_BOOL). Creation of these modular logs is 
simplified by macro:&]
[s0; &]
[s0; #define [* LOG`_](flag, x)     do `{ if(flag) RLOG(x); `} while(false)&]
[s0; &]
[s0; One such predefined type exists, USRLOG, that is indended to 
log user actions (like opening windows, pressing keyboard keys) 
and can be activated by IniBool Ini`::user`_log (and also by setting 
user`_log`=true in .ini file):&]
[s0; &]
[s0; #define [* USRLOG](x)         LOG`_(Ini`::user`_log, x)&]
