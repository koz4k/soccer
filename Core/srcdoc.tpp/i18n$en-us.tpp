[s2; Internationalization and translation files&]
[s0; To internationalize your application, you need to provide versions 
of string literals in all required languages. In U`+`+, you can 
do this using translation files.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; To mark string literals for translation in sources, you have 
to tag them with t`_ macro, like&]
[s0; &]
[s7; printf(t`_(`"Hello world!`"));&]
[s0; &]
[s0; This macro is expanded to function that provides translation 
of English (more specifically en`-US) text to default language 
set by SetLanguage function. String literal here is considered 
to be the key for translation lookup. U`+`+ supports three forms 
of keys here:&]
[s0; &]
[s0;i150;O0; plain keys are just en`-US texts. Example: t`_(`"Hello 
world!`")&]
[s0;i150;O0; context keys consist of context and en`-US text separated 
by `\v, where both are parts of key. Example: t`_(`"align`\vTop`"). 
This is useful in cases when context is needed to provide translation.&]
[s0;i150;O0; id keys consist of id and en`-US text separated by `\a, 
but only id is used as key in translation lookup. Example: t`_(`"CtrlCoreReport`\a
Report`"). &]
[s0; &]
[s0; Important: t`_ tag can be used with string literals only.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; t`_ macro expands to function call that provides translation 
of given literal. Where this is not acceptable (like in arrays 
of literals), tt`_ tag can be used `- it is expanded to literal 
alone and that can be later converted using GetLngString macro.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Translations are stored in .t files of regular packages. Format 
of this file is rather simple `- it is set of keys followed by 
translation of keys to required languages. Key is introduced 
by T`_, translation, translations are introduced by their language 
codes, e.g.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; T`_(`"Sideways`")&]
[s0; csCZ(`"Na šířku`")&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Language codes for other languages may be found in Core, within 
the lcid.txt file (found in the Languages section).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; TheIDE provides means for manipulating .t files `- in Workspace 
menu there is `"Synchronize translation files`" operation. This 
operation scans all source files of current project and builds 
map of t`_ tagged string literals and then combines this information 
with any valid .t files it finds. This operation also allows 
adding new languages to .t files.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; t. files are always in UTF8 encoding.  To change the encoding 
for your file, you can right`-click on the file in TheIDE, and 
select `'Convert to encoding...`'.  Note that if you use Windows 
Notepad to save the file as UTF`-8, you may need to strip out 
the BOM that Windows may have included, or you may experience 
compiling errors.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; TheIDE also maintains translation repository `- it stores ALL 
translations that it meets into this file. Each time .t file 
is synchronized, TheIDE tries to supply all missing translations 
from repository and also adds all translation existing in .t 
file back to repository. This is e.g. great when some source 
is moved to another package.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; U`+`+ also supports run`-time translations (as opposite to compile`-time 
.t files). You can use `-`-export`-tr in any U`+`+ application 
to force creation of runtime translation file (with .tr extension). 
Parameters of this flag is 4 letter language code and single 
letter character set encoding according this table:&]

[s0; example:&]
[s0; &]
[s7; myapp `-`-export`-tr dede2&]
[s0; &]
[s0; will create dede2.tr file (in exe directory on Win32 and user`'s 
home folder on Posix) ready for translation to deDE in windows`-1252. 
If translations are already present, they are supplied, otherwise 
.tr file contains English strings in place of translations.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; It is also possible to output secondary already translated language 
to .tr file as comments (e.g. in case that translator cannot 
understand English, but can understand some other language):&]
[s0; &]
[s0; &]
[s7; myapp `-`-export`-tr dede2 cscz&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Each U`+`+ application performs search for .tr files at startup 
and uses them to extend internal translation tables.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; .tr files can be also imported to .t files using TheIDE`'s `"Import 
runtime translation`" function of Workspace menu. Note that this 
function does not add new languages to .t files `- just adds 
translations to languages added manually.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; When `-`-export`-tr is used without parameter, it exports all 
compile`-time languages. This is useful for maintenance purposes.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; You will need to include the following in [* one of your compiled 
files (not a header)]:&]
[s0; &]
[s7; #define TFILE <YourProject/YourTranslations.t>&]
[s7; #include <Core/t.h>&]
[s0; &]
[s0; where `'YourProject/YourTranslations.t`' would be a path to 
your translations file.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; To set your application`'s language to the user`'s default language, 
add the following somewhere early in your application`'s execution:&]
[s0; &]
[s7; SetLanguage( GetSystemLNG() );&]
[s0; &]
[s0; In multithreaded applications this setting works on per`-thread 
basis (since release 5061); threads inherit the language setting 
of main thread on startup.]]
