[s2; New features of U`+`+ Core 2016&]
[s3; Allocator&]
[s5; U`+`+ allocator now always returns 16`-byte aligned blocks. 
This is to simplify SSE requirements, at the price of smallest 
possible allocation being 32`-bytes (request for smaller blocks 
are rounded up to 32`-bytes).&]
[s0; In situation where allocating a lot of blocks smaller than 32 
bytes (typical is controlling reference counter block in shared`_ptr 
like class), new [* TinyAlloc] / [* TinyFree] functions can be used, 
or templated `"new/delete`" like functions [* tiny`_new] / [* tiny`_delete].&]
[s3; Multithreading&]
[s5; One of biggest advances of C`+`+11 is support for multithreading 
memory model. That is why we could drop U`+`+ memory model support 
and use what language/standard library provides `- [* Atomic ]is 
now reimplemented using [* std`::atomic<int>], thread local variables 
are language standard. OTOH, beyond memory model, U`+`+ [* Thread 
]class and [* CoWork ]class are still basis of multithreading.&]
[s5; [* ConditionVariable ]is now recommended over [* Semaphore]. We 
keep U`+`+ class for this one, because in Win32 [* ConditionVariable 
]requires Windows 7 and we still want to keep WinXP support (U`+`+ 
[* ConditionVariable ]contains internal implementation when system 
API is missing).&]
[s5; [* Thread`::Exit] can be used to exit the thread (from within), 
similar to [* Exit ]to exit the whole program. It throws exception, 
which is caught at the end of thread routine.&]
[s5; [* CoWork ]was optimized and also changed so that each `"master 
thread`" has private thread pool. This is important to avoid 
stealing of work between master threads, which can lead to problems 
(e.g. delays in the GUI).&]
[s5; [* CoWork`::FinLock] now provides `'finalization lock`', useful 
to avoid additional mutex lock for e.g. storing results.&]
[s5; [* CoWork ]now also has pipeline support, where thread performs 
one specific task and eventually passes results to another thread 
to continue processing.&]
[s3; Callback changes&]
[s5; Callbacks are refactored with C`+`+11 lambdas and varargs templates. 
There are now 3 classes:&]
[s5; [* Function ]is similar to [* std`::function], generic callable with 
any number of parameters and any return value in addition it 
has ability to `'add`' functions using operator<<. Also, unlike 
[* std`::function], calling empty Function is no operation, not 
exception.&]
[s5; [* Event ]is equivalent of Callback `- unlike Callback, it is 
not necessary to have Callback, Callback1, Callback2, number 
of parameters is resolved by C`+`+11 template varargs.&]
[s5; Callback is deprecated but supported for backward compatibility.&]
[s3; Algorithms and Containers&]
[s5; The set of algorithms provided by U`+`+ is now streamlined by 
introduction of [/ Range] concept. Range is entity that provides 
begin/end/GetCount/operator`[`] methods. All U`+`+ algorithms 
expect Range as input. All U`+`+ containers satisfy Range concept. 
In addition there are&]
[s5; [* SubRangeClass ]`- represents subrange of container, or just 
begin/end pair.&]
[s5; [* ConstRangeClass ]`- trivial single`-value range&]
[s5; [* ViewRangeClass ]`- is basically a list of indicies inside another 
range. [* FilterRange] function can create ViewRangeClass based 
on predicate.&]
[s5; U`+`+ containers now support [* InsertRange]/[* AppendRange ]template 
methods.&]
[s5; New, parallel algorithms are introduced: [* CoLoop], [* CoAccumulate], 
[* CoSum], [* CoFindBest], [* CoFindMin], [* CoMin], [* CoFindMax], [* CoMax], 
[* CoFindMatch], [* CoFindIndex], [* CoSort],[*  CoStableSort],[*  CoIndexSort], 
[* CoStableIndexSort], [* CoIndexSort2], [* CoStableIndexSort2], [* CoIndexSort3], 
[* CoStableIndexSort3], [* CoGetSortOrder], [* CoGetStableSortOrder], 
[* CoSortByKey], [* CoSortByValue], [* CoStableSortByKey], [* CoStableSortByValue], 
[* CoSortIndex], [* CoStableSortIndex].&]
[s3; Tuple&]
[s5; Tuple now does not require the specific template type based 
on number of elements (instead of Tuple3<int, int, String> it 
can now be used just Tuple<int, int, String>). Tuple now has 
methods for retrieving the number of elements and index based 
access of elements via Value and also C`+`+11 like access via 
template methods (index based or type based):&]
[s7; [* Tuple]<int, String> x `= [* MakeTuple](12, (const char `*)`"hello`");&]
[s7; -|&]
[s7; DUMP(x.a);&]
[s7; DUMP(x.b);&]
[s7; DUMP(x);&]
[s7; &]
[s7; DUMP(x.[* GetCount]());&]
[s7; DUMP(x.[* Get](0));&]
[s7; DUMP(x.[* Get](1));&]
[s7; DUMP(x.[* GetArray]());&]
[s7; DUMP(x.[* Get<0>]());&]
[s7; DUMP(x.[* Get<String>]());&]
[s7; -|&]
[s7; x.Set(1, `"bar`");&]
[s7; DUMP(x);&]
[s7; ValueArray va `{ 22, `"world`" `};&]
[s7; x.[* SetArray](va);&]
[s7; DUMP(x);&]
[s5; Unfortunately, as `'Tuple`' id now represents template class, 
`'Tuple`' function had to be removed. Use MakeTuple instead.&]
[s3; Changes in r`-value and pick&]
[s5; All features required for compatibility with C`+`+99 (pick`_ 
etc...) were removed in favor of using r`-value references. `"picked`" 
state was removed, picking now simply clears the source to `"empty`" 
state. AddPick methods in containers are deprecated, use Add(pick(x)) 
instead. `'pick`' is kept as synonym to std`::move and clone is 
still required (containers do not provide default copy constructor).&]
[s5; Throughout library, `"opportunity`" r`-value constructors/assignments 
are added. That has perhaps the most optimizing effect with chaining 
String operator`+: String a; ... String x `= a`+ `" foo `" `+ 
`"bar`" does not perform any unnecessary copies now.&]
[s3; Smaller issues&]
[s5; Stream`::SerializeRaw count is now int64 (instead of 32`-bit 
int)&]
[s5; 2GB items limit is better implemented in StringBuffer, WStringBuffer, 
StringStream.&]
[s5; StringStream now has SizeLimit option, if breached (when storing 
data to StringStream), exception is thrown.&]
[s5; NanoStrings class is removed.&]
[s5; HashFn / precomputed hash options in Index/Maps are removed.&]
[s5; Index/Maps are further optimized (about 5% gain in benchmarks).&]
